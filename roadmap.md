# Rendering

A notebook consists of an ordered list of cells. Each cell can be markdown content or source code with executed outputs. Currently we use `marked.js` to render markdown content and a full size monaco editor for source code.

Currently there are still two three missing pieces:

- MIME Types
  - [ ] LaTeX. Users may use them in both Markdown Cell or Outputs.
  - [ ] `application/json`.
  - [ ] `image/*`. We render PNG and JEPG in core but svg and gifs should be rendered in webview/iframe. (GIF support is a must as we don't support videos).
  - [ ] `application/scripts`.
  - :suspect: What about other Mime types? What about adding new mime types ourselves? (Custom API referenced below might handle this)
- Metadata
  - [ ] Cell metadata which controls the renderings of cells, like `editable`, `execution_count`
  - [ ] Output metadata, like whether the output should be rendered in an isolated context.
  - [ ] Metadata **editing**
- Comm between output and extension
  - [ ] 2Ô∏è‚É£  API for extensions to talk to the output rendered in webview

Fulls lists of cell types, output mime types and metadata we may want to support are listed below.

## Cell

- Code Cell
  - [x] Render source code in regular editor
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ üèÉ Editor height grow with content.
    - Note: make sure word wrapping and folding (one example for content widgets) work properly.
  - [ ] View output in seperate view. For example view output in fullscreen
  - :suspect: Will editor extensions work? 
  - :suspect: How is language server going to be hooked up?
  - :suspect: Can we provide more than one language server for a cell? (Jupyter auto complete)
  
- Markdown Cell
  - [x] Live Preview
    - [x] Editor/Preview splited vertically
    - [ ] Side by side. Ref [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16RMW8h7h2zcfuamLkhWucf2ooo82yky1#scrollTo=0h0u01uSB4nT)
  - [ ] Markdown engine
    - [x] Commonmark
    - [x] GFM
    - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ LaTeX
    - [ ] HTML
    - [ ] Video. Note that VS Code doesn't ship with ffmpeg
    - [ ] Attachments. References to local resources.

## Output 

Refs:

* [jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_formats.html)
* [ipython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.core.formatters.html?highlight=text%2Flatex#IPython.core.formatters.DisplayFormatter)

The following MIME types are usually implemented by Notebook client. We track all mime types we support with [test files](https://github.com/rebornix/notebook-test/blob/master/samples/mimetypes.ipynb).

- Stream
  - [x] Text
  - [x] Error/ANSI
  - :suspect: We reformat this output ourselves. At the render spot as we don't want our reformat to be saved into the notebook. 
- Display Data
  - [x] text/plain
  - [x] text/markdown
  - [x] text/html
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ text/latex
  - [x] image/png
  - [x] image/jpeg
  - :suspect: Same with jpeg/png/svg. We add extra controls onto the output at render time.
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ image/gif
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ image/bmp
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ image/svg+xml
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ application/javascript
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ application/json
  - [ ] application/pdf
  - [x] Interactive JavaScript wigets. Contributed by extensions, like ipywidget or vega/vega-lite
  - [ ] **Custom Mime Types** (`application/vnd*`). Similar to above, might require API extensibility for contributing custom vendor mime types handler
  
 :suspect: What about completely custom cells like Facebook has for SQL data?
 :suspect: What about dynamically updating cell output over time? What does the API for generating output look like?

Notebook outputs might have mutiple mimetypes and notebook clients will choose the richest mime type they can render. The display order for mime types can be as below

* application/json
* application/javascript
* text/html
* image/svg+xml
* text/markdown
* text/latex
* image/svg+xml
* image/gif
* image/png
* image/jpeg
* application/pdf
* text/plain

Internally a notebook client should maintain two lists, one for mime types it can render and one for the display order.


## Cell metadata

Cell metadata is used to control the rendering of a cell, for example we can disable editing of markdown cells by setting `editable` to `false`.

Refs: [nbformat](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#cell-metadata)

- [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ editable
- [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ deletable
- [ ] collapsed
- [ ] scrolled
- [ ] name
- [ ] tags
- [ ] format
- [ ] jupyter (namespace)
  - source_hidden
  - outputs_hidden
- [ ] execution (namespace)

## Output metadata

Output metadata can provide information of how to render an output.

Refs: [nbformat](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#output-metadata)

- [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ isolated. isolated output should be isolated into an iframe
- [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ dimensions. `"metadata" : { "image/png": { "width": 640, "height": 480, } }`
- needs_background

# Editor Features

Notebooks contain text (markdown) and source code, so users would expect [code editing features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) from the notebook editor. 

- Workspace
  - [x] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Save
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ SaveAs
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Save
  - [ ] Hot Exit
  - [ ] View States
    - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cursor/Selection. Cursor states should be tracked when users scroll the notebook (our virtualization optimization leads to state loss now).
    - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Move editor across editor groups and persist states
- Basic Editing ([ref](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics))
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Find & Replace in File. Users might want to F&R in editable markdown cells too.
  - [ ] Find & Replace in Cell 
  - [ ] Multi cursor across cells
  - [ ] Undo/Redo across cells. Cell operations should be saved to Undo stack as well.
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cursor movement across cells.
  - [ ] Minimap for the whole notebook document
  - [ ] Snippets. Code snippets and cell snippets
  - [ ] Diff. 
    - [ ] Text based diff. This one might require API works as notebook documents might not be persistent on disk.
    - [ ] Rich Diff. Similar to NBViewer, the core needs to diff and render rich diff.

# Cell Manipulation

Currently we put all cell related actions in the context menu but it's not easily accessibable, we may want to have a better UX to ensure users can be **productive**.

Refs: [jupyterlab api for cell management](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/notebook.html)

- UX polish
  - [ ] Run code cell, Edit
  - [ ] Toolbar for other actions
- Commands
  - [x] Create new markdown cell
  - [x] Create new code cell
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Move Cell
  - [x] Delete Cell
  - [ ] Drag and Drop. Supported in JupyterLab
  - [ ] Expand/Collapse outputs
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Undo/Redo cell manipulation
  - [x] Execute code cell
  - [ ] Cell selection
  - [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clear output
  - :suspect: Split cell? Merge Cell? Extensibility points around this?

## Commands/Keybindings

Jupyter notebook web app has two modes: Command mode and Edit mode, which is similar to Vim's mode system. In Command mode, users can use keybindings to manipulate cells while Edit mode is used to edit content.

Keybindings in Edit mode are pretty close to VS Code's builtin keybindings however Command mode has many conflicts with the core. We are going to implement the commands and users (or we) can build keymaps on top of them.

# Language Features

Source code in code cells in a notebook are loosely coupled. You can import a module in one code cell and then use it directly in another code cell, however it doesn't mean that the `import` cell has to be layed before the other cell. As long as the `import` cell is executed first, the other cell is valid.

When the notebook is not connected to a kernel or the execution sequence is unknown (which requires users' input), the language service for code cells needs to be fuzzy. The language service for the notebook may want to analyze all code cells and provide hints/suggestions based on heuristics.

Language features can fall into following groups by their requirements

## Definiton/Suggestion

To support **Completions**, **Parameter hints**, **Hover** and **Diagnostics**, language service will read live content from every code cell

- [ ] API: Expose code cells contents and event listeners for content change
- [ ] Extension register themselves as language features providers

## Navigation

Code navigation includes **Go to Definition/Implmenation**, **References/Peek View** and **Call hierarchy**. The challenge here is jumping between code cells in a notebook, instead of opening a regular code editor.

- [ ] Core: Support opening editor/models from a notebook document

## Edits across cells

Features like **Refactoring** and **Rename** might require Workspace-like Edits.

- [ ] Core & API: Support edits for multiple code cells


## Embedded model support

**Formatters** and **Symbols** can work seamlessly on individual code cells but we may also want a Notebook level (between normal document and workspace) formaters or symbols provider

- [ ] Format notebook (format cells with different languages)
- [ ] Notebook symbols (combination of symbols from different cells)


## Cell agnostic

Following features can be cell agnostic and we need to make sure the code cells are labeled as the right language

- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] Link detection
- [ ] Color
- [ ] Folding
- [ ] Codelens

# Debug

In Jupyter Notebook, you can run code cell line by line and the kernel behaves like a debugger. In theory, debugging a code cell is similar to debugging a file. The notebook provider provides content from the active code cell in current notebook document, and initializes the debugging session with the kernel. The provider is also the debug adapter in this case.

We need to validate if this can work and investigate how debugging should work when the kernel is not connected.

# Other Extensibility points
 - :suspect: Variable explorer? Can probably do this in a side window
 - :suspect: Kernel selection?
 - :suspect: Controlling the kernel like:
    - Run all cells? Interrupt kernel? Restart Kernel?
 - :suspect: How will starting a kernel/server happen? 
    - We support remote and local. Need some way to indicate which is connected
    - We support starting a server on open. Will we get a notification on opening an ipynb file? 

# MISC

- [ ] :musical_note: I don't really like the idea of having to keep our own implementation of notebook UI for our interactive experience use. I think it would be prudent to review the differences between what notebooks support and what the interactive window does to see if we can't come up with a framework that would support both. Some differences between the two:
  - A cell contains code that is read-only and collapsible.
  - The cell manipulation buttons are placed differently better account for SxS view with a python file.
  - Cells can't be inserted, nor can they be reordered.
  - There is an input box at the bottom of the window that acts as an embedded terminal window of sorts that is used for appending new cells. 
  

Bugs / Polish items

- [x] Notebook file not loaded from extension when opened the second time
- [ ] Activation events for notebook provider. Activate extension when a notebook file is opened.
- [ ] Editing in nested code editor, cursor should always be visible.
